    "# Object Oriented Programming with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets look at what Wikipedia has to say about [Object Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of \"this\" or \"self\"). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "They essentially allow you to write **[DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) code.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two main ingredients for Object Oriented Programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data {aka State or Property}\n",
    "1. Methods {procedures that change this Data}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Class: This is an extensible program-code template for creating objects, providing initial value for state and implemtnation of behavious. \n",
    "1. Instance/Object: Concrete occurance of the a `Class`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts in OOPs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Abstraction: `Abstract` means idea or concept not associated with particular instance. A class should not know the inner details, instead it should know about **interfaces** \n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Implies keeping Data and Functions safe from outside interference. This is also reffered to as data hiding \n",
    "1. Inheritance: These allows us to re-use code by means of `inheriting` properties and method from an existing class. There are couple of ways this can be done via `is-a` relationship or `has-a` relationship. The latter one is also called `Composition` which is a good practices.\n",
    "1. Polymorphism: `Polymorphism` implies taking more than one form -- it implies ability to process objects of different types\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets look at an examples. We're implementing a simple program that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accept Deposit of Cash\n",
    "1. Enquiry available balance\n",
    "1. In case of Savings account it will show potential earnings\n",
    "\n",
    "### NOTE: Use best tool for the job, you can get away without writing classes. Look at this talk on [YouTube:  Stop writing Casses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0) \n"

    "\n",
    "1. `__init__` is the initializer and note constructor. Next section talks about having multiple constructors\n",
    "1. There are **no access specifiers** in Python that enforce difference between `private` and `public`. By convention anything that begins with `_` {underscore} is private. E.g. `_update_ledger` function\n",
    "1. `self` keywords is self-referential keyword it is similar to `this` keyword in other languages\n",
    "1. There is no `new` keyword required to create an object, just an assignment operation should do it \n",
    "1. Look at how we've passed default arguments E.g. `amount=None`\n",
    "1. For all your methods you will need to pass `self` as first argument by default\n"
